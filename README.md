# K600AnalysisScripts
A collection of useful analysis scripts for working with the K600 spectrometer at iThemba LABS

The currently uploaded scripts are very preliminary and will likely undergo some modifications as Retief uses them for experiment PR193. 
Experiment PR193 serves as the first analysis for which these codes will be used by someone other than myself and I'm sure suggestions for improvements will be forthcoming.

The plan is to to upload a more final comprehensive set of codes once this testing phase is completed.
